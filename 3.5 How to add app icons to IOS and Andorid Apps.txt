3.5 HOW TO ADD ICONS TO THE IOS AND ANDROID APPS 

In this lesson we will learn, How to change your app icon from the default flutter logo to something of your choice

	-Download your required app icon image

	-Then you are going to upload that image to this website :- "https://appicon.co/"

	-Select the required platform and download the zip file which will contain all the 		 icons generated by the website

	-If you peek inside the android folder, you will see some folders that contain 	 	 different sized icons

	-Now we will have to add these files to our project folder, for that we will use the 	 project navigator 

	-Go to "android -> app -> src -> main -> res ->"

	-All the folders that start with "mipmap" are the app icon folders 

	-Simply delete them and replace them with the icons that you downloaded from the 	 website






If you see the icon now, even though you are providing the right sized assets for the app icon, it gets this white circle around it which does not look that pleasing. In order to get a perfect circular icon :- 

	-Follow these steps "https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/3512"

	-right click the res folder -> new -> image asset

	-Pick the path of your image that you initally downladed before putting it on 	 appicon.co

	-Then the wizard will show you your icon in all sorts of different configurations

	-What you can do now is resize the image so that it fits into the space that you 	 want it to be seen in 

	-Once you are done adjusting, click next and the wizard will automatically replace 	 all of the places we had our previous images with the new ones

	-When you re-run the app you will be able to see that changes
