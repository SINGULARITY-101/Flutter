6.7 INCORPORATING CUSTOM FONTS IN YOUR FLUTTER APP

*The steps are very similar like when you want to include an image in your project 

	-Download the required font from "https://fonts.google.com/"

	-Create a new directory in your main project folder called "fonts" and add the ttf 		 file you just downloaded into that directory  

	-Now you ll have to include the custom font in your "pubspec.yaml" file 

	-It is better to copy paste the code from 	 	 		 "https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/fonts"

	-This will help you avoid indentation errors in your "pubspec.yaml" file 



flutter:
  uses-material-design: true

  assets:
    - images/

  fonts:
    - family: Pacifico
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf



	-You will now refer to your custom font with its "family" name

	-Now go into your "main.dart" and update the "Text" widget's "style" property

	-fontFamily: "Pacifico"

	-Now since you have added in a new resource, you will have to rebuild your project 		 from cold by clicking stop and play so that it links up all the necessary things 		 that we need
