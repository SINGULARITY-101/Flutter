6.6 TAPPING INTO WIDGET PROPERTIES

Our layout goes from top to bottom, so we will be using a column as our layout widget 




*The first widget that will come in our column will be something called as "CircleAvatar" 

	-In order to access quick documentation about a widget press "cntrl+q"

	-"CircleAvatar" creates a circle that represents a user. Image will be cropped to 	 	 have a circle shape

	-You can change a variety of properties about it including the "BackgroundImage" and 	 set it as a custom image

	-For that you will have to :-
		*Create a new directory called "images"
		*Add the required images in that folder 
		*Add "images/" under the "assets:" section of your pubspec.yaml file 
		*Run Pub get 
		*Set the "backgroundImage" property as:-
		 backgroundImage: AssetImage("images/dp.jpeg")





*After the image has been included, we will add a text widget below it with our name 

	-You can change a lot about the "Text" widget using the "style" property

	-Set the "style" property as the "TextStyle" widget and then hit "cntrl + q" to look 	 at the various properties you can change
